# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzle implementations on various programming languages.

Main motivation has been to 1) have fun with the puzzles, as well as 2) experiment different programming languages.

Currently experiments include following languages:

  * [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/)
  * [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)
  * [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

Note: Not all puzzles are solved with all languages.
